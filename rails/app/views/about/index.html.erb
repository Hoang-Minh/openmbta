    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <p class="question">
      Q: Why is Bus <em>X</em> missing from the list of bus routes?
    </p>

    <p><strong>A:</strong> If a bus route is done all its trips for the day or isn't
    in service today, it won't show up at all on this list. This is a potential
    source of confusion that might be remedied in the next version of the app.  </p>

    <h3>Mission</h3>

    <p>This app was created to help fight global warming. Global warming is the most serious problem we face right now. And it's a no brainer that we can fight global warming by making the experience of public transportation better and more attractive for people. OpenMBTA is part of a new <strong>green software movement</strong> that calls on developers to donate their time to making free and useful software that helps us save the environment. </p>
