<h3>FAQ</h3>

<p class="question">
Q: Why is Bus X missing from the list of bus routes?
</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If a bus route is done all its trips for the day or isn't
in service today, it won't show up at all on this list. This is a potential
source of confusion that might be remedied in the next version of the app.  </p>

<p> The idea for this iPhone app was born during <%= link_to "Open Government
Hack Day", "http://opengovhackday.pbworks.com/" %>  at <%= link_to "Betahouse",
"http://twitter.com/betahouse" %>  in Central Square, Cambridge, MA on September
27, 2009.  </p>

<p>
The first version of this application was created by Daniel Choi, a Cambridge-based
software developer.
</p>

<p> Chris Dempsey, Assistant Secretary for Innovation and Project Development at
Massachusetts' Executive Office of Transportation (EOT), provided much encouragement
and graciously answered lots of questions.  
</p>

<p>
Braulio Carreno also provided this project with very useful insights into the
GTFS dataset.  
</p>

<p> 
Finally, this project would not be possible without the EOT's serious efforts to make MBTA
data available to outside software developers and to the public.
